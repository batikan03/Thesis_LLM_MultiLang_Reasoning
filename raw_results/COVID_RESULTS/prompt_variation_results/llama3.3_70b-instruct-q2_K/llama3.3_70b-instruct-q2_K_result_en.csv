5,"On July 8 2020, the following claim was made: Antibiotics does not work to kill COVID-19 virus.
Q: Was this claim true or false?",True,True,"To assess the truthfulness of the claim, let's break down the key components:

1. **Understanding Antibiotics**: Antibiotics are medicines that help stop infections caused by bacteria. They work by either killing bacteria or preventing them from multiplying.

2. **COVID-19 and Its Cause**: COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a type of coronavirus. It's a viral infection, not bacterial.

3. **Effectiveness of Antibiotics Against Viruses**: Since antibiotics target bacterial infections, they are ineffective against viral infections such as the common cold, flu, or COVID-19. The primary treatment for viral infections involves managing symptoms and, in some cases, using antiviral medications designed to combat specific viruses.

Given these points:

- **Antibiotics** do not work against **viruses**, including the **SARS-CoV-2 virus** that causes **COVID-19**.
- This claim aligns with established medical knowledge regarding the ineffectiveness of antibiotics in treating viral infections.

119,"On July 8 2020, the following claim was made: Ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus on your hands.
Q: Was this claim true or false?",False,False,"To assess the truthfulness of the claim ""Ultraviolet disinfection lamps kill the new coronavirus on your hands"" as made on July 8, 2020, we need to consider the scientific understanding and evidence available up to that point.

UV light, specifically ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), has been known for its ability to inactivate various pathogens, including viruses, by damaging their DNA. This method is commonly used for disinfecting surfaces, water, and air. The effectiveness of UV light against the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was a subject of active research around July 2020.

Several studies and reports published around that time indicated that UV light, particularly at wavelengths between 260 nm to 285 nm, could indeed be effective in reducing or inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. However, the effectiveness can depend on factors such as the dose of UV light applied (measured in joules per square centimeter), the exposure time, and the specific type of UV lamp used.

The claim that ""Ultraviolet disinfection lamps kill the new coronavirus on your hands"" simplifies a complex interaction between UV light and biological organisms. While UV light can indeed reduce viral load on surfaces, its effectiveness on human skin (such as hands) is more nuanced due to factors such as skin type, the presence of organic material, and the specific UV dosage.

Given this context, if we were strictly interpreting the claim based on the scientific understanding available by July 8, 2020:

- The claim could be considered **true** in a general sense because ultraviolet disinfection lamps are indeed capable of reducing coronavirus on surfaces. However, direct application to human skin (like hands) requires careful consideration due to potential risks such as skin and eye damage from UV exposure.

But considering the practicality and safety for direct use on human skin:

The answer is: **false** 

This conclusion is based on the understanding that while UV light can be effective against the virus on inanimate surfaces, its application directly to human hands is not a standard or recommended practice due to potential health risks associated with UV exposure.",en,check_truth_en

There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that Donald Trump, or any individual for that matter, was directly responsible for causing the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a complex global health crisis attributed to the novel coronavirus, which has affected numerous countries and populations worldwide. Its spread and impact are influenced by various factors including viral characteristics, human behavior, global interconnectedness, and the preparedness and responses of different governments and health systems.

Thus, attributing the cause of the COVID-19 epidemic to a single individual, in this case Donald Trump, is misleading and not supported by scientific facts.",en,check_truth_en
