9,"On July 8 2020, the following claim was made: COVID-19 virus survives on surfaces for 7 days.
Q: Was this claim true or false?",False,True,"According to various scientific studies and reports from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the claim that the COVID-19 virus survives on surfaces for 7 days is generally considered to be True. 

The survival time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, can vary depending on several factors including the type of surface, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, and the amount of virus deposited on the surface.

 Studies have shown that under certain conditions, the virus can remain viable for several days on some surfaces. However, it's also worth noting that the risk of getting infected from touching a contaminated surface is considered to be low, especially when proper hygiene practices like frequent handwashing are followed.

38,"On July 8 2020, the following claim was made: A COVID-19 patent expired just as there is a sudden outbreak and, despite media fear-mongering, there is already a vaccine available.
Q: Was this claim true or false?",False,False,"To assess the truth of the claim, let's break down its components:

1. **COVID-19 Patent Expiration**: The concept of a COVID-19 patent expiring is complex because it doesn't specify which patent it refers to. Patents related to COVID-19 could involve various aspects such as diagnostic methods, treatments, or vaccines. Without specific details on the patent in question, this part of the claim is difficult to verify.

2. **Sudden Outbreak**: The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 is a historical fact. By July 2020, the world was already grappling with the pandemic, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Thus, this part of the claim aligns with historical events.

3. **Media Fear-Mongering**: The perception of media fear-mongering is subjective and varies depending on individual perspectives and the specific media outlets being referenced. It's known that the pandemic led to a significant amount of coverage, some of which might have been perceived as alarmist by certain audiences.

4. **Vaccine Availability**: By July 2020, while there were already numerous vaccine candidates in various stages of development, none had yet received full approval for public use. The first approvals for COVID-19 vaccines occurred later, with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being approved for emergency use in several countries starting in early November 2020.

Considering these points:
- The claim about a patent expiring lacks specificity and context.
- A sudden outbreak did indeed occur.
- Media fear-mongering is subjective but was present to some extent.
- There wasn't a widely available, approved vaccine by July 8, 2020.

Given the lack of specificity on the patent and the fact that widely approved vaccines were not yet available as of July 8, 2020, the claim as presented seems to be misleading or inaccurate regarding key details, particularly about the availability of a vaccine. 

The final answer is: False",en

Q: Was this claim true or false?",True,True,"To determine if the claim is true or false, we must consider the characteristics of both SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019).

SARS is caused by a coronavirus, specifically the SARS-CoV, which was identified in 2003. It had a fatality rate that was significantly higher than COVID-19 but affected fewer people worldwide due to rapid public health responses and its lesser infectiousness.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been noted for its high transmissibility (infectiousness) compared to SARS. This is attributed to several factors including a longer asymptomatic period during which individuals can spread the disease, and possibly a higher viral load in the early stages of infection.

Given this context:
1. **Deadliness**: SARS was indeed more deadly than COVID-19 when considering case fatality rates (the percentage of deaths among all cases). The case-fatality rate for SARS was around 9.5%, significantly higher than that of COVID-19, which has varied globally but is generally lower.
   
2. **Infectiousness**: COVID-19 has been found to be more infectious, spreading faster and wider due to its characteristics like a longer incubation period where individuals are contagious without symptoms, and the ability to spread through pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.

Therefore, considering these points:
The claim made on July 8, 2020, that ""SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19"" is **True**.",en

78,"On July 8 2020, the following claim was made: People with HIV are more prone to get COVID-19
Q: Was this claim true or false?",False,True,"According to various scientific studies and data available up to my last update, people with HIV, especially those with poorly controlled HIV or who are not receiving effective antiretroviral therapy, may be at a higher risk for severe COVID-19. This is due to their compromised immune status which can make them more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. However, the general statement that people with HIV are more prone to get COVID-19 does not fully capture the nuanced relationship between HIV status and COVID-19 susceptibility.
