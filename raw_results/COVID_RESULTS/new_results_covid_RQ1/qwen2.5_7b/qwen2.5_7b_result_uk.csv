1,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: COVID-19 може поширюватися від людини до особи. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,True,True,"The statement in Ukrainian says, ""On July 8, 2020, such a statement was made: COVID-19 can spread from person to person.""

This claim is true. The basic understanding that coronavirus (COVID-19) can be transmitted from one person to another has been widely accepted and documented by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health authorities since early 2020, long before July 8th of that year.

The virus was initially identified as a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It was later confirmed to be highly transmissible among humans through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. This information was well-established and widely reported by the scientific community and health organizations before July 8, 2020.

Decision: True"
2,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: найпоширенішими симптомами COVID-19 є гарячка, втома та сухий кашель.",True,True,"This headline is in Ukrainian and states that on July 8, 2020, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.

The information provided is accurate. These are indeed some of the early identified primary symptoms of COVID-19 and have been widely reported by health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) since the beginning of the pandemic.

Therefore, my decision is: True"
3,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: головним способом поширення COVID-19 через дихальні крапельки. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,True,True,"The statement "" головним способом поширення COVID-19 через дихальні крапельки"" (the main way of spreading COVID-19 through respiratory droplets) is correct. This method of transmission has been widely recognized by health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Respiratory droplets are considered a primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially in close-proximity settings.

Decision: True"
4,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: період інкубації COVID-19 від 1 до 14 днів.,True,True,"The statement in the headline is true.

The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time from infection to symptom onset, has been widely reported by health organizations such as the CDC and WHO to range from 1 to 14 days. Therefore, a claim made on July 8, 2020, about this incubation period would align with the established scientific understanding.

Decision: True"
5,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: антибіотики не працюють для того, щоб знищити вірус COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",True,True,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was stated that antibiotics do not work to kill the COVID-19 virus.

This claim is generally true based on current medical understanding. Antibiotics are designed to combat bacterial infections and have no effect on viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly emphasized this point during the pandemic, advising against using antibiotics for treating viral infections.

Decision: True"
6,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вже існує вакцина для лікування COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""On July 8, 2020, it was claimed that there already exists a vaccine for treating COVID-19"" is false.

By July 8, 2020, while several vaccine candidates were in development and testing phases, no vaccines had been approved or widely distributed. The first COVID-19 vaccines would not be officially authorized until later in 2020 by regulatory bodies such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Decision: False"
7,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: чистка рук не запобігає COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""чіска рук не запобігає COVID-19"" translates to ""Hand washing does not prevent COVID-19.""

This is false. Hand hygiene, including frequent hand washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, is one of the most effective measures for preventing the spread of viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

Therefore, the decision is: False."
8,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 те ж саме, що і SARS. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""COVID-19 те ж саме, що і SARS"" translates to ""COVID-19 is the same as SARS."" This is false.

While both are coronaviruses and share some similarities, they are distinct pathogens. COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) belong to different subgenera within the genus Coronavirus. They have differences in their genetic makeup, symptoms, and transmission patterns.

Decision: False"
9,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вірус COVID-19 виживає на поверхні протягом 7 днів. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"The statement mentions that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that the COVID-19 virus can survive on surfaces for seven days.

Based on scientific research and updates from health organizations like the CDC and WHO, the survival time of the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) on different surfaces has been studied. According to these studies, the virus can remain viable on various surfaces for several hours or days but not up to seven days as stated.

Therefore, the statement is False.

Decision: False"
10,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 походить від тваринного харчування.,False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: COVID-19 originates from animal consumption.""

Analysis:
This statement is partially based on existing scientific research and discussions but is not verifiably true or false without context because it's a broad claim. The relationship between zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans) and the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is an area of ongoing scientific investigation.

Several studies have suggested a possible connection between animal consumption and the virus's emergence, particularly after the 2019 Wuhan outbreak. However, as of now, no definitive proof has conclusively linked any specific form of animal consumption to SARS-CoV-2 origins.

Since we cannot confirm with certainty that this exact statement was made on July 8, 2020, and given the evolving nature of scientific understanding about the virus's origin, the headline is not definitively true or false based on verifiable information alone.

Decision: False"
11,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ""Covid-19"" - загальний грип. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?",False,False,"This headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: 'Covid-19' is general flu.""

The statement is false. The term ""Covid-19"" refers to a specific coronavirus disease that emerged in late 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. It is not considered a form of ""general flu,"" which typically refers to influenza viruses such as seasonal H1N1 or other related illnesses.

Decision: False"
12,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: сонячне світло може вбити вірус з'єднаного 19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"The headline states that on July 8, 2020, a claim was made that solar light can kill the virus SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).

This statement is not entirely accurate. While sunlight can inactivate some viruses and reduce their infectivity, there is no conclusive evidence that it can effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 or prevent its spread under normal circumstances.

Solar light, particularly ultraviolet radiation, does have disinfectant properties. However, the specific wavelengths of UV light required to effectively kill coronaviruses (such as UVC) are harmful to human skin and eyes and cannot be safely applied in a manner that would protect people from infection while they go about their daily lives.

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can survive on various surfaces for extended periods under normal environmental conditions. Effective preventive measures include frequent hand washing with soap and water, using alcohol-based sanitizers, maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing respiratory hygiene.

Therefore, the headline is an overstatement of what solar light can achieve in the context of virus prevention and control.

Decision: False"
13,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: відбілювач алкоголю може допомогти вилікувати вірус з'єднаного 19.,False,False,"This headline is in Ukrainian and translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, it was claimed that a deodorant could help treat the coronavirus.""

Analysis: The statement about using a deodorant to treat the coronavirus is false. There is no scientific evidence supporting this claim. To date, there are only vaccines and specific antiviral medications approved by health authorities for treating or preventing COVID-19 (officially known as ""coronavirus"" due to its discovery in 2019). Any claims suggesting non-approved methods can treat the virus should be considered unverified and potentially harmful.

Decision: False"
14,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: домашні ліки можуть вилікувати чи запобігти COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""Domestic remedies can cure or prevent COVID-19"" was made on July 8, 2020.

This headline is referring to a claim that some domestic (likely home-based) remedies could treat or prevent COVID-19. However, based on medical knowledge and public health guidelines, no such remedies have been scientifically proven effective against the virus. The World Health Organization and other reputable health authorities consistently advise following established prevention methods like wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination.

Therefore, the answer is: False

The statement is false because there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that any home remedies can cure or prevent COVID-19."
15,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 - це рукотворний тероризм для вбивства людей.,False,False,"This statement was made on July 8, 2020. The claim that COVID-19 is a deliberately created act of terrorism to kill people contradicts the scientific consensus and evidence available at the time. While there have been conspiracy theories suggesting the virus's artificial origin, these claims lack credible scientific support. Therefore, the headline contains a false statement.

Decision: False"
16,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: тепло може вбити COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: heat can kill COVID-19.""

Analysis:
Heat and elevated temperatures generally do inactivate viruses. However, specific studies on SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) have shown that while higher temperatures reduce its viability, the virus can still survive at typical ambient temperatures found in many parts of the world.

Given this context, it is accurate to say that heat can affect the survival of SARS-CoV-2. However, a statement claiming that ""heat can kill COVID-19"" may be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of more nuanced scientific findings.

Decision: False

The headline simplifies the effect of temperature on the virus in a way that might not fully capture the complexity of the situation as understood by virologists and public health experts."
17,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: сушені руки можуть вбити COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""сушені руки можуть вбити COVID-19"" translates to English as ""dry hands can kill COVID-19.""

This claim is false.

Reasoning: The statement misrepresents the nature of how hand sanitizers work. Hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol are effective in killing SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Dry hands themselves cannot kill the virus; it requires an active disinfectant like alcohol to break down the viral particles.

Decision: False"
18,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID- 19 можна передати через пошту. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"The statement ""COVID-19 can be transmitted through mail"" was not accurately made on July 8, 2020, based on the current understanding of the virus and medical research.

The primary modes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) are believed to be:

1. Respiratory droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.
2. Close contact with an infected person, including touching surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching your face.

While there have been reports of contamination of mail packages, this is not considered a significant mode of transmission for COVID-19. The virus does not survive well on most surfaces and is primarily spread through respiratory droplets.

Given these facts, the headline's statement can be considered inaccurate in its emphasis that ""mail"" is an effective means of transmitting the virus.

Decision: False"
19,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: діти не можуть отримати COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""dіti ne mogut otрimatи COVIД-19"" translates to ""Children cannot get COVID-19.""

This is false. According to the World Health Organization and numerous scientific studies, children can contract COVID-19. While symptoms may be milder in some cases compared to adults, there are documented instances of children testing positive for the virus.

Decision: False"
20,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: люди, які отримають COVID-19, помруть.",False,False,"This headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: people who get COVID-19 will die.""

The claim in this statement is false. The emergence of a virus like SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) and its impact on human health are complex scientific issues. While there were early uncertainties about how deadly the disease would be, it was never accurately stated or widely accepted that everyone who gets infected will die.

During the pandemic, public health experts advised that while severe cases can occur, many people recover from mild to moderate symptoms with appropriate care. The severity of COVID-19 varies based on factors such as age, underlying health conditions, and overall immune response.

Therefore, the answer is: False"
21,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено заяву: 5G мобільних мереж розповсюдили COVID-19 Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, a claim was made that 5G mobile networks spread COVID-19. This is a known conspiracy theory that has been debunked by health experts and scientific communities worldwide.

Analysis:
- There is no credible evidence supporting the idea that 5G technology causes or spreads diseases.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) has consistently stated that 5G technology has nothing to do with the spread of COVID-19.
- Multiple governments and telecommunications companies have issued statements refuting such claims, emphasizing that 5G is safe.

Given this context, the statement is part of a well-known conspiracy theory without any factual basis. Therefore, the headline should be considered false in terms of it being scientifically accurate or widely accepted by the scientific community.

Decision: False"
22,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: піднімаючи себе до сонця або піднімаючи температуру вище 25C градусів, щоб запобігти хворобі COVID- 19. Ч: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"This statement is false.

The claim suggests that lifting oneself to the sun or increasing temperatures above 25C can prevent COVID-19. However, based on scientific understanding and public health guidelines from reputable sources such as WHO and CDC, these actions are not effective methods for preventing COVID-19. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact between people; therefore, measures like wearing masks, maintaining social distance, washing hands frequently, and getting vaccinated are recommended to prevent the disease.

Decision: False"
23,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ви не можете відновитися після COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""ви не можете відновитися після COVID-19"" translates to ""you cannot recover after COVID-19.""

This claim is false. Based on medical knowledge and data, the majority of people who contract COVID-19 can recover. While severe cases do occur, recovery is possible with proper treatment and management. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that while there are some patients left with long-term effects, many people recover from the disease.

Decision: False"
24,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Ловлення COVID-19 означає, що ви отримаєте його для життя Ч: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""Ловлення COVID-19 означає, що ви отримаєте його для життя"" translates to ""-catching COVID-19 means you get it for life"" in English. This is a false claim.

COVID-19 is not a lifelong condition for everyone who contracts it. While some people experience severe symptoms and might have long-term health effects, others recover fully or have only mild symptoms. Moreover, the virus can be successfully treated with various medical interventions, and vaccines are available that significantly reduce the risk of severe illness.

Decision: False"
25,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: бути здатним затримати дихання 10 секунд або більше без кашлю або відчуття дискомфорту означає, що ви вільні від COVID- 19 або будь- якої іншої хвороби легенів.",False,False,"The statement in the headline is fabricated and not based on medical facts or guidelines from reputable health organizations. The ability to hold one's breath for 10 seconds or longer does not serve as a reliable method to diagnose COVID-19 or any other respiratory condition.

According to WHO and CDC guidelines, there are no such simple self-assessment methods using breath-holding capacity to determine if someone is free from COVID-19. Diagnosis of COVID-19 involves testing for the virus through molecular tests (PCR), as well as clinical evaluations by medical professionals based on symptoms and exposure history.

The claim in the headline appears to be part of misinformation spreading online, often linked to pseudoscientific health claims or attempts at self-diagnosis that lack scientific basis. Therefore, the statement is false.

Decision: False"
26,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: алкоголь захищає вас від COVID-19 і може бути небезпечним Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""алкаголь захищає вас від COVID-19 і може бути небезпечним"" translates to English as ""alcohol protects you from COVID-19 and can be dangerous.""

This claim is false. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that alcohol protects against COVID-19. In fact, excessive alcohol consumption can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of severe illness if a person contracts any virus, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).

Therefore, the answer is: False"
27,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вірус COVID-19 НЕМОЖЛИВО передається в районах з гарячим і вологим кліматом Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement mentions a claim made on July 8, 2020, that the COVID-19 virus cannot be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. This is not accurate based on the scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

As per multiple studies and health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no strong evidence to suggest that hot and humid weather significantly reduces the spread of the coronavirus. The virus can be transmitted in all types of weather conditions, as it primarily spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person when they talk, cough or sneeze.

Therefore, the headline stating that the virus cannot be transmitted in areas with a hot and humid climate is false.

Decision: False"
28,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: холодна погода та сніг можуть вбити COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""холодна погода та сніг можуть вбити COVID-19"" translates to ""Cold weather and snow can kill COVID-19.""

This claim is False. There is no scientific evidence or consensus among health experts that cold weather or snow can directly kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. While viruses like influenza are more common in colder months, this is primarily due to people spending more time indoors and increased transmission, not because of any direct effect of temperature on the virus itself.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that temperatures do not necessarily impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2 significantly. The virus can survive and be transmitted under various weather conditions, making claims about specific weather conditions killing the virus unfounded and unsupported by current scientific understanding.

Decision: False"
29,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: прийняте гарячу ванну запобігало хворобі COVID-19. Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""прийняте гаряча ванна запобігало хворобі COVID-19"" (taking a hot bath prevented COVID-19) is false. 

This claim was widely debunked early in the pandemic. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that taking a hot bath or any other home remedy can prevent or treat COVID-19, which is caused by a virus and requires medical interventions such as vaccines and appropriate treatments.

Therefore, my decision based on this analysis is: False."
30,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: оп'яніння чи хлор по всьому тілу вбиває COVID-19 Q: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""оп'яніння чи хлор по всьому тілу вбиває COVID-19"" translates to ""drinking alcohol or chlorine throughout the body kills COVID-19."" This claim is false.

Reasoning: There is no scientific evidence supporting the notion that drinking alcohol or chlorinated water can effectively kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. In fact, consuming large amounts of alcohol can be harmful to one's health and may weaken the immune system. Chlorine is a potent disinfectant used in pools and for wastewater treatment but should not be ingested.

Decision: False"
31,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вакцини проти запалення легенів захистять людей від COVID-19: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"This headline translates to English as follows:

""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: vaccines against pneumonia will protect people from COVID-19: is this statement true or false?""

The statement in the headline suggests that vaccines for pneumonia would provide protection against COVID-19. However, it is known that the main cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is a different virus from those causing typical pneumonia. Vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are mRNA vaccines specifically designed to target SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, based on the current understanding of virology and vaccine development:

False"
32,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: регулярне проколювання носа солью захищало людей від зараження COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was said that regularly applying salt to the nose protected people from contracting COVID-19.

This claim is false. There is no scientific evidence supporting that regular nasal irrigation with salt water (which can be beneficial in some cases for general nasal health) could protect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization and other health authorities have not recommended salt water nasal irrigations as a preventive measure against COVID-19.

Decision: False"
33,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: "" Їсти часник допомагає запобігти зараженню COVID-19 Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""Їсти часник допомagaє запобігти зараженню COVID-19"" translates to ""Eating garlic helps prevent COVID-19 infection."" This is a known misconception. Garlic has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties, but there is no scientific evidence that eating garlic can prevent or cure COVID-19.

The World Health Organization and other health authorities have not endorsed the consumption of garlic as a method to prevent COVID-19. The main methods recommended by these organizations are vaccination, wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, washing hands frequently, and following local public health guidelines.

Therefore, the statement is False."
34,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: молоді люди не отримають COVID-19 Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""молоді люди не отримають COVID-19"" translates to ""Young people do not get COVID-19.""

This claim is false. Young people can and do contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. While older age groups have a higher risk of severe illness, younger individuals are not completely immune and should take necessary precautions.

Decision: False"
35,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: антибіотики ефективні у запобіганні та лікуванні COVID-19: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement in the headline is about a claim made on July 8, 2020, that antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating COVID-19. This claim is false.

Antibiotics do not work against viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. They are only effective against bacterial infections. Misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat bacterial infections effectively in the future. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health authorities have repeatedly advised against using antibiotics as a prevention or treatment for COVID-19.

Decision: False"
36,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: кров, що тече, є одним із симптомів COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement ""кров, що тече, є одним із симптомів COVID-19"" translates to ""Blood that flows is one of the symptoms of COVID-19."" This statement is false.

COVID-19 symptoms are well-documented and include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. While blood issues can occur in severe cases of COVID-19 (such as blood clots), the statement is overly broad and not accurate for the general population experiencing mild to moderate symptoms.

Decision: False"
37,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: що подразнення шкіри є одним із симптомів COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,True,"The statement in the headline is translated to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, it was stated that skin irritation is one of the symptoms of COVID-19.""

To analyze this claim:

Skin irritation or rashes have been reported by some patients suffering from COVID-19, although they are not a common symptom. Medical professionals and health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have documented various less common symptoms associated with COVID-19, including skin manifestations.

Therefore, based on current medical knowledge and reports, this statement is generally considered to be true. However, it's important to note that while some patients may experience skin irritation or rashes, these are not universally experienced by all individuals with the virus.

Decision: True"
38,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: патент COVID-19 вичерпано так само, як раптовий спалах і, незважаючи на страх перед медіа, вже існує вакцина.",False,False,"The statement mentions a patent on the COVID-19 virus running out and an existing vaccine being developed without any specific evidence or reliable source provided to support these claims. As of July 8, 2020, there were no widely reported patents running out for the virus itself; rather, there was significant global effort in developing vaccines against it. While some vaccines did enter clinical trials by that time, widespread distribution and confirmation of their efficacy would not have been achieved as quickly.

The headline contains elements that are not accurate based on the current understanding and timeline of vaccine development up to July 8, 2020. Therefore, the statement is False.

Decision: False"
39,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: випивання розчину відбілювача не дасть вам отримати COVID-19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження, чи ні?",False,False,"The statement says: ""On July 8, 2020, this claim was made: drinking bleach solution will not give you COVID-19.""

This is false.

The headline incorrectly reports that drinking bleach would not cause COVID-19. In reality, the claim made on July 8, 2020, and circulating since then warns against consuming bleach as it can severely harm your health or even be lethal. The statement aims to debunk such dangerous misinformation by clearly stating that ingesting bleach is extremely harmful but does not give you COVID-19.

Decision: False"
40,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: науковці шоковані тим, що бур'яни вбивають вірус COVID-19 Q: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"This headline translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: scientists are shocked that thunderstorms kill the COVID-19 virus.""

The claim in this headline is false. Thunderstorms cannot directly kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The virus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets and close contact between people. It does not survive well in high temperatures or dry conditions, but these are conditions typically found inside thunderstorms rather than what would affect a virus.

Moreover, there is no scientific evidence supporting the claim that thunderstorms can kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While weather phenomena such as sunlight and high humidity levels could potentially reduce viral survival rates, it's not accurate to say they directly ""kill"" the virus in the sense implied by this statement.

Therefore, the answer is: False"
41,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Copain вбиває вірус COVID-19, вчені шокують себе, коли дізнаються, що цей препарат може боротися з вірусом.",False,False,"This headline translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: Copain kills coronavirus, scientists shock themselves when they learn that this drug can fight the virus.""

The claim in the headline is false.

Reasoning:
1. **Copain**: This term does not refer to a known entity or individual involved in any scientific discovery related to combating COVID-19.
2. **Coronavirus**: While there were numerous treatments and vaccines being researched, no specific drug named ""Copain"" was identified as effective against the virus by mainstream science at that time (or since).
3. **Scientists' reaction**: The phrase ""scientists shock themselves"" is hyperbolic and not based on factual reporting of scientific reactions to any particular discovery.

**Decision:** False"
42,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 не впливає на мусульман Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"To analyze the given headline, we need to consider whether it is true that on July 8, 2020, there was a statement claiming that COVID-19 does not affect Muslims. 

The statement in question seems to be an assertion about the effects of the virus specifically on Muslims. However, as of my last update, there is no credible evidence or known official statements from health authorities indicating that COVID-19 has different impacts based on religious affiliation.

Moreover, scientific and medical communities have consistently stated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, affects all people regardless of their religion. The severity of the disease can be influenced by various factors including underlying health conditions, but there is no evidence to support that it specifically does not affect Muslims.

Therefore, based on this analysis and without any supporting evidence from reliable sources, the statement appears to be false.

Decision: False"
43,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: Тканина волосся і мереживні фронти, виготовлені в Китаї, можуть містити COVID-19: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?",False,False,"The statement refers to a claim made on July 8, 2020, that textiles and network fabrics manufactured in China might contain COVID-19. This claim is based on misinformation and lacks scientific evidence supporting the transmission of the virus through such materials.

To determine if this claim is true or false:

1. **Scientific Evidence**: There is no credible scientific evidence to support the idea that viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) can survive in significant quantities on textiles and then infect people through contact.
   
2. **Public Health Recommendations**: Public health guidelines emphasize the importance of other transmission routes such as respiratory droplets, close person-to-person contact, and contaminated surfaces. There are no recommendations from reputable public health authorities about avoiding certain fabrics or materials.

3. **Chinese Authorities Statements**: Chinese health officials have not issued statements corroborating this claim. Official sources focus on other measures for preventing the spread of the virus.

Given these points, the headline is based on unfounded claims and misinformation.

**Decision: False**"
44,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: президент Дональд Трамп породив вибух вірусу Вахана супер COVID-19 під кодовою назвою zyphr. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"This statement is false.

The claim that Donald Trump caused a virus named ""Vahana super COVID-19"" under the code name ""zyphr"" on July 8, 2020, is not based on any factual evidence. There are no credible sources or verified reports supporting this assertion. Such claims without basis in actual events or data are often part of conspiracy theories.

Decision: False"
45,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: не існує вірусу COVID-19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"This headline states that on July 8, 2020, a statement was made claiming there is no such virus as COVID-19.

The claim is false. Based on the widely accepted scientific consensus and reports from health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has been extensively researched and confirmed to exist. Statements denying its existence are inconsistent with established virology and epidemiology.

Decision: False"

This claim is false.

Reasoning:
- While both SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and the influenza virus belong to the family of viruses known as RNA viruses, they are not comparable in their severity, transmission patterns, or health impacts.
- Medical experts have extensively researched and confirmed that COVID-19 is a distinct disease from the flu. It has unique symptoms, modes of transmission, and levels of mortality rate compared to influenza.
- Equating them ignores critical differences in the nature and impact of these viral diseases.

Decision: False"

Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, such a statement was made: a supplement for a fish oil capsule can cure COVID-19.""

This claim is false. As of my last update in October 2023, there are no scientifically validated supplements or any form of fish oil that have been proven to cure or effectively treat COVID-19. The medical community continues to recommend vaccines and treatments based on clinical trials.

Decision: False"
48,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: "" Слизи лимона в чашці гарячої води можуть врятувати вам життя .""",False,False,"The statement refers to a claim made on July 8, 2020, which suggests that the slimy substance from a lemon in hot water could save someone's life. While lemons are known for their health benefits due to vitamin C and other antioxidants, there is no scientific evidence supporting that the slimy substance (which is actually a mixture of pectin and water) from a lemon can be used to save lives in an emergency.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the statement appears to be fabricated or exaggerated.

Decision: False"
49,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: Величезне! Результати з дослідження хлорохіну показують 100% Виплату для хворих, заражених COVID-19.

The results of chloroquine research show a 100% cure rate for those infected with COVID-19.""

This claim is false. While chloroquine has been studied for its potential in treating or preventing COVID-19, there is no scientific evidence supporting the statement that it provides a 100% cure rate. In fact, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown mixed results in clinical trials and can have severe side effects.

50,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: сонячне світло насправді може вбити роман COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""On July 8, 2020, it was stated that solar light can actually kill the Roman COVID-19"" is false.

Explanation:
There is no known scientific evidence or credible research to support the claim that solar light (sunlight) can kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing COVID-19. While sunlight and ultraviolet radiation can have some disinfectant properties, they are not effective against viruses in the way this headline suggests.

The decision is: False"
51,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: ""Вукі ПАРМА ЛЕБ"", розташований у Вахані Китай, розвинув вірус COVID-19."" Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The headline translates to: ""On July 8, 2020, the statement 'Vuki Parmar developed the coronavirus in Vahnan, China' was made.""

To analyze this:

1. **Verification of Date and Statement**: The date is specific (July 8, 2020), which makes it easier to verify against official records or reports from that time.

2. **Entity Mentioned**: ""Vuki Parmar"" does not match any known names associated with significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic as of my last update.

3. **Location and Virus Association**: The location, Vahnan, is not a recognized place name, especially not related to China or the context of the coronavirus.

4. **Coronavirus Development Claims**: There are no credible sources that link any individual named Vuki Parmar with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19.

Based on these points, and considering the lack of evidence supporting this claim in reputable sources:

**Decision: False**"

The claim in the headline is false. There is no scientific evidence that suggests ingesting COVID-19 would cause such effects on bodily fluids. The statement is a fabrication and does not align with medical knowledge about how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, interacts with the human body.

Decision: False"

The headline translates to ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was issued: In 2019 COVID-19 through two hours of sun exposure was killed: is this statement true or fake?"" This claim is not supported by any scientific evidence and is a clear example of misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic. There is no credible scientific basis for believing that simply being exposed to sunlight can kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Decision: False"
54,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 було винайдено і запатентовано в США, а потім посаджено в Китай.",False,False,"This headline is false.

The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was announced that COVID-19 had been invented and patented in the United States, and then ""planted"" in China. This is a conspiracy theory without any scientific or factual basis. Multiple authoritative health bodies have stated that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) emerged from natural origins, not as an invention.

Decision: False"
55,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: люди кольору можуть бути імунізованими до COVID-19, тому що причиною був Меланін. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was stated that people of certain skin colors could be immunized against COVID-19 due to melanin being the cause. This is a false claim.

Melanin does play a role in skin pigmentation and potentially affects how much UV light reaches deeper layers of the skin, but there is no scientific evidence linking melanin directly with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 or any specific immunization status against COVID-19. Vaccines are designed to trigger an immune response regardless of skin color.

Therefore, the answer is: False"
56,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 можна сповільнити або зупинити за допомогою негайного повсюдного вживання високої дози вітаміну C.C.: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that COVID-19 could be slowed or stopped by immediately and universally using high doses of vitamin C. This is not a true claim based on the scientific consensus.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has various health benefits, including its role in collagen synthesis and immune function support, but there is no robust evidence supporting that it can effectively treat or prevent COVID-19 at high doses. The World Health Organization and other credible health authorities do not recommend high-dose vitamin C as a preventive or therapeutic measure against the virus.

Therefore, the statement is false.

Decision: False"

The claim in this headline is false. The assertion that COVID-19 is a biological weapon created by the Chinese military has no basis in scientific fact or credible evidence. Numerous global health organizations and governments have investigated the origins of the virus and concluded that it most likely emerged through natural means rather than being intentionally engineered as a biological weapon.

Therefore, the decision is: False"

The claim that the coronavirus was designed and created in a laboratory is a conspiracy theory that has been widely debunked by public health experts and scientific communities. Numerous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is of natural origin.

Therefore, based on available scientific consensus, this statement is false.

Decision: False"
60,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Комуністична партія Китаю нарешті погодиться, що справжнє джерело COVID-19 походить з "" лабораторії у Вахані"" пов'язаної з її прихованими біологічними програмами зброї. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement refers to a claim made on July 8, 2020, that the Communist Party of China has finally agreed that the true source of COVID-19 originated from a ""laboratory in Wuhan"" linked to its covert biological weapons programs. This is a highly contentious and unverified claim.

There is no credible evidence to support this specific assertion made by the headline. Various health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have not identified any definitive proof that the COVID-19 virus originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. The origin of the virus remains under investigation.

Therefore, based on current scientific understanding and available information:

Decision: False"
61,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Китай викрав COVID-19 з Канади і за допомогою зброї перетворив його на біопіон.,False,False,"This headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: China smuggled COVID-19 from Canada and used weapons to transform it into a bio-agent.""

This claim is highly unlikely to be true based on available scientific evidence and public health information. It includes several unfounded assertions that contradict established facts about the origin of SARS-CoV-2, which has been traced back primarily to natural wildlife sources through international scientific research.

The assertion that China smuggled the virus from Canada and transformed it is not supported by any credible source or evidence. The origins of COVID-19 are a subject of ongoing scientific investigation, but no reliable reports support this specific claim.

This statement is based on the actual situation during the pandemic. It aligns with reports from various health authorities indicating that asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) was a known phenomenon. Therefore, this information is consistent with factual accounts.

Decision: True"
64,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: Джерело SARS-COV-2, коронавірус (COV) спричиняючи COVID-19 невідомий: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",True,False,"The statement ""On July 8, 2020, such a statement was made: The source of SARS-COV-2, the coronavirus (COV) causing COVID-19 is unknown"" can be analyzed based on scientific consensus and available information.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has been extensively studied since its discovery. The scientific community widely accepts that it originated from a bat and was likely transmitted to humans through an intermediary animal, most commonly suggested to be a pangolin. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence including genetic analysis, virology research, and epidemiological studies.

Therefore, the statement claiming that ""the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (COV) causing COVID-19 is unknown"" is not accurate based on current scientific knowledge.

Decision: False"
65,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 має природне походження тварин, і це не є побудований вірус Q: чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",True,False,"The statement in question is partially correct and incorrect. The claim that the COVID-19 virus has a natural animal origin is generally supported by scientific consensus, which does not support the idea of it being a ""lab-built"" virus intentionally created for biological warfare or similar purposes.

However, the specific wording suggesting that it's not a ""built virus"" can be misleading because some scientists and researchers have raised hypotheses regarding possible laboratory origins of SARS-CoV-2 as part of studies to understand its evolution. These hypotheses were proposed based on the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses found in nature, leading to debates and discussions within the scientific community.

Given this context, the headline is attempting to frame a particular view that aligns more with the general scientific consensus but is not entirely accurate as it oversimplifies ongoing scientific debate. 

Decision: False"

This claim is based on established scientific knowledge and public health information that has been widely reported and confirmed by numerous health organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO). The transmission of COVID-19 between individuals through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces was known and acknowledged at the time the statement was made in July 2020.

Therefore, my decision is: True."
69,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 в основному передається через контакт з респіраторними крапельками. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,True,True,"The statement ""COVID-19主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播"" is translated to English as ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: COVID-19 mainly spreads through respiratory droplets.""

This statement is true. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health authorities have long stated that COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

Therefore, the decision is: True."
70,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: "" Чисті руки допомагають запобігти отриманню COVID-19 .""",True,True,"The statement in the headline is a factual health advice that has been widely disseminated and is true.

This advice is indeed correct and consistent with public health guidance issued by many organizations worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has long recommended that people avoid touching their face as a way to reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

Therefore, my decision is: True"

This information is generally accurate based on scientific understanding and public health guidelines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the incubation period for COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, most commonly about 5 days. 

Therefore, the decision is: True"
73,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: на даний час немає вакцини і противірусних ліків, які б запобігали чи лікували COVID-19 Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",True,True,"The statement ""on July 8, 2020, it was stated that as of now there is no vaccine or antiviral drugs that prevent or treat COVID-19"" was indeed made. On July 8, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement acknowledging that while multiple vaccines and antiviral treatments were in development phases, none had been approved for use as of that date.

However, by the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines had already entered clinical trials and some began to be authorized or approved for emergency use. Therefore, this statement is true as of July 8, 2020, but it would not be accurate in 2020 towards the end of the year.

Decision: True"
74,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: САРС було смертоноснішим, але набагато менш заразним, ніж COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?",True,False,"The statement in the headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, it was stated that SARS was more deadly but much less contagious than COVID-19.""

To analyze this:

1. **SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)** and **COVID-19** are both serious respiratory illnesses.
2. Historical data on the spread and impact of these viruses is available.

According to scientific studies:
- SARS had a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 during their respective outbreaks, with reports indicating that the case fatality rate for SARS was approximately 9.6%, while for early cases of COVID-19, it was about 2%.

However, regarding contagiousness or transmissibility (R0 value - the average number of people an infected person will infect):
- The R0 value for SARS was estimated to be around 2.5 to 3.7.
- For COVID-19, early estimates were around 2.24 to 3.86 but have varied over time.

Therefore, while the statement correctly notes that SARS had a higher fatality rate than early stages of COVID-19, it does not accurately describe SARS as being ""much less contagious"" than COVID-19 in most historical contexts.

**Answer: False**

This is because SARS was generally considered to be more transmissible than what the statement claims."
75,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 відрізняється від SARS. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,True,True,"The statement ""COVID-19 відрізняється від SARS"" translates to ""COVID-19 differs from SARS."" This is a factual claim that can be evaluated based on scientific knowledge.

Both COVID-19 and SARS are caused by coronaviruses, but they have some differences:
1. The virus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV) is different from the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).
2. While both can cause severe respiratory illness, their clinical presentations may differ.
3. SARS had a higher mortality rate in earlier outbreaks compared to the current variants of COVID-19.

Given these differences and based on scientific consensus, the statement is correct.

Decision: True"
76,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: лише старші люди і молодь ризикують захворіти на COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement in the headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this claim was made: only older people and youth are at risk of contracting COVID-19.""

This claim is false. As of July 8, 2020, it was well understood that individuals of all ages could contract the virus, although there were initial concerns primarily about older adults and those with underlying health conditions. By this time, various studies had begun to show that people across different age groups were susceptible to infection.

Decision: False"
77,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: ""Кітці і собаки не отримують COVID-19."" Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement in the headline is false. The claim that ""Cats and dogs do not get COVID-19"" was found to be incorrect based on the scientific understanding of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can infect a wide range of species, including cats and dogs. While the risk of animals getting severely ill from the virus is generally low, they can contract it and potentially spread it to other animals under certain conditions. This has been observed in several cases around the world.

Therefore, the decision based on this analysis is: False."
78,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: люди з ВІЛ більш схильні отримувати COVID-19 Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"This headline translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: people from Vilnius are more likely to get COVID-19.""

To analyze the truthfulness of this claim:

1. **Context and Source**: The original claim does not specify a source or any supporting evidence for this assertion.

2. **General Health Statistics**: There is no widely recognized data or research indicating that residents of Vilnius, Lithuania are more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to other regions globally. Similar claims about different cities have been investigated and generally found to be without substantial support from reliable health statistics.

3. **Vilnius and Pandemic Response**: While specific local measures can influence the spread of a virus in any given city, there is no evidence provided that would suggest Vilnius specifically had higher rates due to its residents' characteristics or behavior alone.

Given these points and without any supporting factual data provided for the claim about Vilnius, we cannot consider this statement as being based on reliable and verifiable facts. It appears more like a speculative assertion rather than a grounded medical observation.

**Decision**: False"
79,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 - це лише мутована форма звичайної застуди.,False,False,"This statement is in Ukrainian, which translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: 'COVID-19 is just a mutated form of the common cold.'""

The claim that COVID-19 is merely a mutated form of the common cold is false. This view contradicts scientific understanding and evidence gathered by global health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a completely new pathogen distinct from any other known coronaviruses that cause common colds.

Therefore, the headline is False."
80,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ви повинні бути з кимось протягом 10 хвилин, щоб зловити COVID-19.

This claim is false. There is no scientific evidence or research suggesting that a person can contract the virus by being in contact with an infected individual for just 10 minutes. The primary modes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, are through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces.

The statement might be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of public health guidelines regarding social distancing, but it is not based on any scientifically verified information about the virus's transmission dynamics. Therefore, the answer to whether this claim was true or false is:

False"

Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""On July 8, 2020, such a declaration was made: Thermal scanners can diagnose COVID-19"" appears to be false based on the current knowledge and available information. As of my last update in October 2023, thermal scanners are not used for diagnosing COVID-19. They are typically used for screening body temperature as an initial indicator of fever, which could suggest potential illness but is not specific to COVID-19.

Decision: False"
83,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: парцели з Китаю можуть поширювати COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: parcels from China may spread COVID-19.""

This claim is not unique or unprecedented. The coronavirus pandemic led to various claims and concerns about the transmission of the virus through different means, including imported goods. However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the notion that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces long enough to be transported in parcels from China to other countries and still be infectious.

Given this context and considering the lack of supporting scientific evidence for such a claim, we can evaluate it as follows:

The statement does not present any specific information or source; it is a general assertion. While such concerns are understandable during a pandemic, there is no credible basis for it being factually true in the sense that parcels from China spread COVID-19.

Decision: False"
84,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ви можете спіймати COVID-19 від споживання китайської їжі в США. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?,False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, a claim was made that you can contract COVID-19 from consuming Chinese food in the United States. This specific claim is false.

The origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been extensively studied and widely agreed upon by health experts and scientific communities. The virus most likely originated in Wuhan, China, but there is no credible evidence linking consumption of Chinese food to contracting the virus. COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

Therefore, the headline is **False**."
85,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 є найсмертоноснішим вірусом, відомим людям.",False,False,"The statement in the headline claims that on July 8, 2020, it was said that COVID-19 is the deadliest virus known to humanity.

As of my knowledge cut-off date in 2023, while SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) has caused significant global mortality and morbidity since its emergence, as of early 2020, there were other viruses that are generally considered more deadly over the long term. For example, influenza and HIV have both caused much higher cumulative death tolls historically.

Therefore, this statement is likely to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation for dramatic effect.

Decision: False"
86,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 започатковано в лабораторії Китаю.,False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that COVID-19 started in a Chinese laboratory. This is a specific claim made by certain individuals and media outlets but it does not represent a widely accepted or verified fact.

Multiple health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have investigated the origins of the virus and stated that there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that COVID-19 originated in a laboratory. Most scientific consensus leans towards the idea that the virus likely emerged naturally from an animal host.

Therefore, based on the available information and the lack of widespread acceptance by health authorities, this claim is not considered true.

Decision: False"
87,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: спалах COVID-19 почався через те, що люди їли суп з кажанами.",False,False,"This headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: the outbreak of COVID-19 started because people ate soup with pig lungs.""

The statement is false. There is no scientific evidence or credible reports linking the consumption of pork products to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The origins of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) are believed to be from a wildlife source, most likely bats, with an intermediate host possibly being another animal, but not pigs. This specific claim is part of unfounded conspiracy theories and not supported by public health authorities or scientific research.

Decision: False"
88,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено заяву: 5G допомагає поширювати COVID-19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?,False,False,"The headline states that on July 8, 2020, a statement was made claiming that 5G technology helps to spread the COVID-19 virus.

This claim is based on misinformation and conspiracy theories that have been debunked by public health officials and scientific communities. There is no credible evidence supporting the idea that 5G technology has any connection to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the development of COVID-19.

The statement in the headline, therefore, is spreading false information.

Decision: False"
89,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: алкоголь зменшує ризик зараження COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement in Ukrainian claims that on July 8, 2020, it was said that alcohol reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19. This claim is false.

Alcohol does not reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19; in fact, consuming alcohol can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other health authorities have consistently stated that there is no evidence to support the idea that drinking alcohol helps protect against or prevent the virus. On the contrary, excessive consumption of alcohol has been linked to serious health issues, including respiratory problems.

Therefore, the headline is false."
90,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: новий COVID-19 було навмисно створено або випущено людьми. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: новий COVID-19 було навмисно створено або випущено людьми"" translates to ""On July 8, 2020, it was claimed that the new COVID-19 was intentionally created or released by people.""

This claim is false. There is no credible scientific evidence supporting the idea that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) was intentionally created or released by humans. The vast majority of scientists and health organizations worldwide agree that the virus likely emerged naturally from a wildlife source.

Therefore, the decision is: False."
91,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: замовлення чи купівля товарів з - за кордону змусить людину отримати COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?,False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, such a statement was made: procurement or purchase of goods from abroad will force a person to get COVID-19.""

This statement is false. There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that importing goods from abroad directly causes the contraction of COVID-19. The virus primarily spreads through close contact with infected individuals and airborne transmission.

Therefore, the decision is: False"
92,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: новий COVID-19 - це респіраторний вірус.,True,False,"The statement in the headline is false.

Analysis:
- The headline mentions a specific date, July 8, 2020.
- It claims that on this date, it was stated that ""noviy COVID-19 - це респіраторний вірус"" which translates to ""new COVID-19 is a respiratory virus.""
- This claim is not accurate. The virus responsible for causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has always been classified as a type of coronavirus, which is indeed a respiratory virus. Therefore, this statement does not provide any new or incorrect information about the nature of the virus.

Decision: False"
93,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: клінічне відновлення м'яких випадків COVID-19 становить приблизно 2 тижні і є 3-6 тижнів для пацієнтів з серйозною або критичною хворобою.,True,True,"The statement in Ukrainian refers to the timeline for recovery from mild cases of COVID-19 and those with serious or critical illness. According to current medical understanding, mild cases of COVID-19 typically resolve within 2 weeks, while it can take up to 3-6 weeks for more severe cases.

Analysis:
- The timeframe given (2 weeks for mild cases, 3-6 weeks for serious/critical) aligns with the current consensus among medical authorities.
- However, it's important to note that this information is based on general trends and individual recovery times can vary widely depending on the patient's health status and other factors.

Decision: True"
94,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: курці, ймовірно, будуть більш вразливими до COVID- 19 як дія на куріння, означає, що пальці контактують з губами, що збільшує ймовірність передачі вірусу з руки в рот. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи ні?",True,False,"This headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: 'Cigarettes, probably, will be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to smoking, which means that fingers come into contact with lips, increasing the likelihood of virus transmission from hand to mouth.'""

The claim in the headline is misleading and not accurate. Smoking does increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 but it is because of respiratory issues and lung damage caused by smoking, rather than direct contamination of cigarettes or hands. The statement incorrectly suggests that cigarettes themselves become more vulnerable to the virus.

Therefore, the answer is: False

This conclusion is based on current scientific understanding which indicates that smoking increases the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 through respiratory complications, not because the cigarette itself becomes more susceptible to the virus."
95,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 не було відомо до того, як спалах вибухнув у Вуган Китаї в грудні 2019 року: чи було це твердження правдивим чи хибним?",True,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, a claim was made that COVID-19 was not known until the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This is incorrect because SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, was identified much earlier than this date.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) that they had identified a previously unknown virus as the cause of the outbreak in Wuhan. This information indicates that the virus and disease were known before the claim mentioned in the headline.

Therefore, the statement is false.

Decision: False"
96,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: деякі тварини можуть заразитися COVID-19 шляхом тісного контакту з зараженими людьми.,True,True,"The statement in the headline is translated to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: some animals can now be infected with COVID-19 through close contact with infected humans.""

This claim is mostly true but requires context for accuracy.

As of early 2020, several animal species had been found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) under certain conditions. This includes animals in laboratories and domesticated pets like cats and dogs. However, the primary focus has always been on human-to-human transmission.

In July 2020, studies were already underway and some cases of animal infections had indeed been reported, confirming that while not all animals can contract COVID-19 from humans, it is possible under certain circumstances.

Given this information, we can say that the headline accurately reflects what was being observed in scientific circles by mid-2020. However, it's important to note that the statement is a generalization and not an absolute fact for all animal species.

Decision: True"
97,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The headline is incomplete and does not provide the specific statement to be verified. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given information.

Decision: False"
98,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 - це абревіатура захворювання коронавірусів 2019. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи неправильне?,True,True,"The statement ""COVID-19 is an abbreviation for coronavirus disease 2019"" is actually correct, but it's important to note that COVID-19 is not technically an abbreviation of the full term. It stands for ""Corona Virus Disease 2019."" The term was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020 to provide a name for this specific disease while avoiding any reference to its geographical or other origins.

Given the context and the direct question about the truthfulness of the statement, we can conclude:

Decision: True"
99,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: період карантину для COVID-19 - це 14 днів від останньої дати експозиції.,True,True,"The statement mentions a claim made on July 8, 2020, that the quarantine period for COVID-19 is 14 days from the last date of exposure. This information is accurate according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and many other health authorities at the time.

Decision: True"
100,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: комарі чи кліщі поширюють вірус, який викликає COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, it was stated that mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus causing COVID-19. This is false.

Mosquitoes and ticks are not known to be vectors for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The primary modes of transmission for this virus are respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, as well as contact with contaminated surfaces followed by touching the mouth, nose or eyes.

While there have been reports and studies on other viruses being spread by mosquitoes, no credible scientific evidence has linked SARS-CoV-2 to these insects. The statement is likely a misinterpretation or misinformation regarding how the virus spreads.

Decision: False"
101,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: CDC рекомендує людям носити накидку, щоб прикрити ніс і рот у громадському оточенні для захисту від COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",True,False,"The statement in the headline is translated to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: CDC recommends that people wear a mask to cover their nose and mouth in public settings for protection against COVID-19.""

In reality, on June 2, 2020, the CDC did indeed issue guidelines recommending that people wear cloth masks in public settings to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, July 8, 2020, is not the date when this recommendation was first made.

Given this information, we can conclude:

False

The headline incorrectly states the exact date on which the CDC recommendation was issued."
102,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: будь- хто може отримати COVID- 19, незалежно від раси чи кольору шкіри. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?",True,True,"The statement ""восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: будь-хто може отримати COVID-19, незалежно від раси чи кольору шкіри"" translates to ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: anyone can get COVID-19, regardless of race or skin color.""

This is a true statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health organizations have consistently stated that COVID-19 is a disease that affects people across all races and ethnicities equally, without any distinctions based on racial or skin color factors.

Therefore, the answer is: True"
103,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: люди з такими захворюваннями, як астма, серцеві захворювання та діабет, мають вищий ризик серйозно захворіти від COVID-19: чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",True,True,"The statement is in Ukrainian and translates to English as follows:

""On July 8, 2020, this claim was made: people with conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetes have a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Is this statement true or false?""

Based on medical knowledge and public health guidelines, this statement is **True**.

The reasoning:
- Asthma can weaken the respiratory system.
- Heart disease complicates recovery due to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply.
- Diabetes affects immune function and healing processes, making it harder for the body to fight off infections like COVID-19.

These conditions are well-documented risk factors for severe outcomes of COVID-19."
104,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: немає доказів того, що COVID-19 зберігся у воді чи стічних водах.",True,False,"The statement provided is in Ukrainian and translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: there is no evidence that COVID-19 can survive in water or standing waters.""

To analyze the accuracy of this claim, we need to consider the current scientific understanding regarding the survival of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) in aquatic environments. Numerous studies have shown that the virus can indeed survive for extended periods in water and wastewater at varying temperatures and pH levels.

Given this information, the statement is inaccurate as it contradicts well-established scientific research on the topic.

Decision: False"
105,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: більшість людей видужують після COVID-19 без необхідності лікування лікарнями.,True,False,"The headline states that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that most people recover from COVID-19 without the need for medical treatment.

This statement is not accurate based on the current scientific understanding and public health recommendations at that time and since then. Most people who recover from COVID-19 require some form of care or treatment, although many mild cases can be managed at home under supervision. However, severe cases often require hospitalization and specific treatments like oxygen therapy or ventilators.

Therefore, the statement is false in its implication that most people do not need medical treatment after contracting the virus.

Decision: False"
106,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 може витримати температуру вище 25 цельсія. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,True,False,"The statement suggests that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that COVID-19 can withstand temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius.

According to scientific understanding and available data from health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, does not thrive at higher temperatures. The WHO has stated that the virus is less stable in environments with higher temperatures and humidity. It's important to note that temperatures above 56 degrees Celsius are required to inactivate the virus. However, this temperature range is well above normal human body temperatures and common environmental conditions.

Therefore, the claim that COVID-19 can withstand temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius is not accurate based on current scientific knowledge.

Decision: False"
107,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вірус COVID- 19 також може поширюватися, коли інфікована людина чхає, кашляє чи видихає, і люди навколо неї вдихають ці мікро- крапельки. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?",True,True,"The statement in the headline is a true claim based on scientific understanding and evidence.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has long acknowledged that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets contain viral particles that other people can inhale, leading to infection.

Therefore, the statement is accurate and based on established scientific knowledge and public health guidelines.

Decision: True"
108,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: одягання медичної маски може обмежити поширення деяких респіраторних вірусних захворювань, у тому числі COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи неправильне?",True,True,"The statement is based on the claim made on July 8, 2020, that wearing a medical mask can help limit the spread of some respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19. This claim is supported by scientific evidence and public health guidelines.

Many studies and reports from global health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) have indicated that wearing masks can be effective in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Therefore, the statement is based on factual information.

Decision: True"
109,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: жінки з затвердженими або підозрюваними COVID-19 можуть годувати грудьми, якщо вони хочуть це зробити.",True,False,"The headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can breastfeed if they want to do so.""

Analysis:
This statement is not accurate based on the current scientific understanding and recommendations. While there have been cases of transmission through breastmilk in rare instances, healthcare organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that mothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be able to continue breastfeeding if they wish. However, these recommendations typically advise taking precautions such as wearing a mask during feeding and washing hands before handling the baby.

Decision: False"
110,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: для COVID- 19 інші симптоми, подібні до грипу, такі, як болі і болі, затори носом, потріскування носа, біль у горлі чи діареї, також поширені. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи ні?",True,True,"The statement mentions symptoms of COVID-19 that are indeed recognized and documented by health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). These include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and abdominal discomfort.

Therefore, the headline is True. The statement accurately describes common symptoms associated with COVID-19 as of 2020. 

Decision: True"
111,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: усі сучасні методи контрацепції безпечні для використання, зокрема під час пандемії COVID- 19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?",True,False,"The statement in the headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: all modern methods of contraception are safe to use, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

This claim is too broad and lacks specificity. While many forms of contraception are generally considered safe for most people regardless of whether they have a viral infection like COVID-19, there isn't a single authoritative or universally accepted statement that all modern methods of contraception are completely safe to use specifically due to the unique circumstances of the pandemic.

Different contraceptives can have different considerations during an illness. For example:
- Barrier methods (like condoms) might be recommended for preventing transmission of respiratory viruses.
- Hormonal methods may need adjustments if a person is ill or has certain symptoms.
- Emergency contraception usage guidelines don't change based on the type of viral infection.

Given these complexities, there isn't evidence to support that such a blanket statement was made by any credible organization regarding all modern methods of contraception during the pandemic. 

Decision: False"
112,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Коронавірус не може рости на їжі.,True,False,"The statement ""Coronavirus cannot grow on food"" was made on July 8, 2020.

This claim is false. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 can remain viable in food and other surfaces under certain conditions. However, it does not grow or replicate on foods the way bacteria might. Instead, it can survive for short periods of time but is typically destroyed by proper cooking temperatures or cleaning with standard household disinfectants.

Therefore, based on this information, the statement made on that specific date is incorrect in its complete form. 

Decision: False"
113,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: обробка упаковок продуктів харчування є малоймовірним чинником COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?,True,True,"The statement refers to a claim made on July 8, 2020, which says that processing food packaging is unlikely to be a factor in the spread of COVID-19. According to health authorities like the CDC and WHO, there is no evidence to suggest that food packaging or its processing plays a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Therefore, this statement aligns with the current scientific understanding.

Decision: True"
114,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: кожен ризикує отримати COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,True,True,"The statement ""кожен ризикує отримати COVID-19"" translates to ""everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19"" in English.

This claim is generally considered true based on the widespread nature and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Public health authorities like the World Health Organization (WHO) have consistently advised that everyone is susceptible to contracting the virus unless they take preventive measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and getting vaccinated.

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Decision: True"
115,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: 20% випадків COVID-19 можуть розвинути серйозну хворобу з порушенням дихання.,True,True,"The headline is in Ukrainian and states that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that 20% of COVID-19 cases can develop serious illness with respiratory issues.

To analyze this statement, we need to refer to public health data and reports from reputable sources. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health organizations, studies have consistently indicated that around 80% of COVID-19 patients experience mild symptoms, while approximately 20% can develop a serious illness requiring hospitalization, which often includes respiratory issues.

Given this context, it is accurate to state that on or around July 8, 2020, the proportion of severe cases was being reported as about 20%.

Decision: True"
116,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 можна передати через очі.,False,False,"This headline states that on July 8, 2020, it was claimed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through eyes.

Analysis: According to scientific understanding and available literature, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 can be transmitted through the eyes in a manner distinct from general viral transmission routes.

The statement may have been misinterpreted or fabricated as an attempt to spread misinformation about how the virus spreads. However, based on established scientific consensus, this specific claim is not accurate.

Decision: False"
117,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: беручи додаткову кількість вітаміну C, можна запобігти COVID-19. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи неправильно?",False,False,"The statement in Ukrainian translates to: ""On July 8, 2020, this claim was made: by taking an additional amount of vitamin C, one can prevent COVID-19.""

This claim is false. While vitamin C is important for overall health and supports the immune system, there is no scientific evidence that it can prevent or cure COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend relying on vitamin C to protect against the virus.

Therefore, the answer is: False"
118,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: спалах COVID-19 був спричинений випадковим витіком з Інституту дослідження вірусів Вугана.,False,False,"The statement mentions a specific claim that an outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by a random leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology on July 8, 2020. This is not accurate based on widely accepted scientific consensus and historical records.

The COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019 and there have been extensive investigations by multiple international bodies that suggest the virus most likely originated from a natural source, possibly a wildlife market in Wuhan, China, rather than an artificial laboratory leak. The claim of a lab accident being the cause has not been supported by credible evidence.

Therefore, the statement is false.

Decision: False"
119,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ультрафіолетова дезінфекційна лампа вбиває на ваших руках новий коронавірус.,False,False,"The statement in the headline is a translation of ""On July 8, 2020, it was claimed that ultraviolet disinfection lamps kill the new coronavirus on your hands.""

Ultraviolet (UV) light can indeed destroy some viruses and bacteria by damaging their DNA or RNA, but specific types and intensities are required. For coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19), UV light needs to be of a certain wavelength and duration to effectively inactivate the virus.

However, direct exposure to high-intensity UV light can cause skin and eye damage. Additionally, there is no evidence that ultraviolet disinfection lamps used as described would kill the coronavirus on human hands when people use their hands normally. The surface of objects or specific areas might be more susceptible, but hand surfaces are typically not exposed directly to such lamps in a way that would be effective at killing the virus.

Therefore, while this claim may have been made and believed by some, it is not accurate based on current scientific understanding of UV disinfection methods for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It's important to use scientifically validated methods like handwashing with soap or using alcohol-based sanitizers instead of relying on potentially harmful UV lamps.

Decision: False"
120,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: Дональд Трамп відповідає за епідемію COVID-19.,False,False,"The statement in the headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: Donald Trump is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Analysis:
This claim can be considered false based on factual information from credible sources and historical records of statements made by U.S. President Donald Trump during his tenure.

The global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic does not place specific responsibility on one individual leader, as the virus spread independently in several regions around the world before it was identified in China. Additionally, while Donald Trump faced criticism for his response to the pandemic, he did not make any statement attributing the origin or development of the pandemic to himself.

Decision: False"
121,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 впливає лише на азіатів і може бути якийсь етнічний біозброй.,False,False,"The headline states that on July 8, 2020, there was a claim that the COVID-19 virus only affects Asians and might be some kind of ethnic biological weapon.

This statement is false for several reasons:

1. **Misinformation**: This claim promotes misinformation and hate speech by suggesting that certain racial or ethnic groups are more susceptible to the virus due to deliberate actions, which is scientifically unfounded.
2. **Scientific Evidence**: Numerous scientific studies and reports from health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, does not discriminate based on race or ethnicity. The virus has been reported to affect people of all races equally.

Therefore, the decision is: **False**."
122,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: Білл Гейтс спричинив зараження COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement in the headline is false.

Explanation: Bill Gates has not been scientifically linked to the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The origin of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as a natural virus through scientific research. Claims attributing the creation or release of the virus to individuals like Bill Gates are unfounded and lack scientific support.

Decision: False"
123,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: спалах COVID-19 був спланований вакцинними компаніями, які сподівалися отримати прибуток.",False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, this statement was made: the COVID-19 pandemic was planned by vaccine companies that expected profit.""

This claim is false. The idea that a global pandemic would be orchestrated by pharmaceutical companies for financial gain contradicts scientific understanding and historical evidence. Here are key points to consider:

1. **Scientific Collaboration**: The development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic involved extensive collaboration between governments, research institutions, and vaccine manufacturers. These entities worked towards a common goal: developing safe and effective vaccines as quickly as possible.

2. **Ethical Concerns**: If such a conspiracy existed, it would have raised significant ethical concerns about the motives behind deliberately spreading a virus to generate profits, which is not aligned with normal business practices or public health ethics.

3. **Evidence of Development Efforts**: The rapid development and widespread deployment of COVID-19 vaccines involved large-scale investments by companies, governments, and international organizations. There's no substantial evidence suggesting that these efforts were driven solely by profit motives at the expense of public health.

4. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and regulatory approval processes to ensure their safety and efficacy. Any attempt to plan a pandemic for financial gain would likely be detected during such scrutiny, making it an impractical strategy.

Given these points, the statement in the headline is not supported by factual evidence and aligns more with conspiracy theories rather than scientific or historical reality.

**Decision:** False"
124,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: уряд США створив і запатентував вакцину для COVID-19 років тому.,False,False,"The statement mentions that on July 8, 2020, the US government created and patented a COVID-19 vaccine years ago. This is false.

Reasoning: The first known mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies around the world in late 2020, not ""years ago"" before that date. While research into vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) began immediately after the outbreak, no vaccine was created and patented so quickly.

Decision: False"
125,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: китайські посадові особи прагнуть отримати дозвіл на масове вбивство 20 000 чоловік для того, щоб зупинити поширення COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The headline translates to English as: ""On July 8, 2020, the following statement was made: Chinese officials aspire to obtain a license for mass murder of 20,000 people in order to stop the spread of COVID-19.""

This statement is highly unlikely to be true. There is no credible evidence or official records supporting such claims about Chinese officials aspiring to commit genocide or mass murder under any circumstances, especially not as a response to a public health crisis like the spread of a virus.

There have been various conspiracy theories and unverified claims related to COVID-19 and its origins, but this specific claim is baseless and without factual support. It appears to be an example of misinformation intended to create fear or promote malicious narratives.

Decision: False"
126,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ви можете запобігти COVID- 19, прикривши ваше тіло в сезамській олії. Q: Чи правильно це твердження чи ні?",False,False,"This statement is false. There is no scientific evidence or medical recommendation suggesting that covering one's body in sesame oil can prevent COVID-19. Such measures are not supported by public health authorities and are considered ineffective against the virus.

Decision: False"
127,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ви можете вилікувати COVID-19, випивши суміш води оцту і китайської медицини Банланген.",False,False,"The statement in the headline is false. The claim suggests that drinking a mixture of water with camphor and traditional Chinese medicine can cure COVID-19. This is based on misinformation and is not supported by scientific evidence or medical authorities worldwide.

Camphor, in particular, is toxic when ingested in large quantities and has no proven antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Consuming it as a remedy can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening.

Therefore, the decision is: False."
128,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 можна уникнути вживання Чудо-мінального Розв'язання, яке, по суті, є вибілюванням.",False,False,"The headline is in Ukrainian and mentions a claim made on July 8, 2020, that COVID-19 can be avoided by using the Miracle Solution, which is essentially a whitewashing of the issue.

Based on my knowledge and available information:
- There is no widely recognized ""Miracle Solution"" for avoiding or treating COVID-19.
- Such claims are often part of misinformation campaigns and pseudoscientific narratives.
- Official health authorities like the World Health Organization have not endorsed any such remedy.

Given this analysis, I can conclude that the headline describes a false claim.

Decision: False"
129,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: спочатку чорний чай є ефективним проти хвороби COVID-19.,False,False,"The statement translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, the following claim was made: black tea is effective against COVID-19.""

Analysis:
Black tea contains antioxidants and other compounds that may have some antimicrobial effects in test tubes and animal studies. However, there is no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of black tea as a treatment or prevention for COVID-19.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities around the world do not recommend drinking any specific beverage to prevent or cure COVID-19. The claim made on July 8, 2020, was likely an unfounded statement based on limited scientific evidence.

Decision: False"
130,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: ""Перець з вапном або лимоном змішується з вірусом COVID-19.""",False,False,"The statement ""Perch with vinegar or lemon mixed with COVID-19 virus"" is a fabricated claim. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that combining perch (a type of fish) with vinegar or lemon can neutralize or interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.

This type of claim often spreads rapidly on social media and other platforms during health crises like a pandemic, but it is based on misinformation. Proper methods to prevent infection include vaccination, mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing as recommended by public health authorities.

Decision: False"
131,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: приглушіть ваше обличчя і вдихніть мелію, яка може запобігти COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement in Ukrainian claims that on July 8, 2020, someone suggested to cover your face and inhale melia, which could prevent COVID-19.

Melia is not known as a substance that can prevent or treat COVID-19. There are no reliable medical sources indicating that inhaling any specific plant or its parts (such as melia) could protect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The statement appears to be based on misinformation.

Decision: False"
132,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: малярія робить людину імунною до COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement ""малярія робить людину імунною до COVID-19"" translates to ""maize makes a person immune to COVID-19."" This claim is false.

Maize, or corn, is a staple food crop and does not have any known properties that would make a person immune to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for causing COVID-19. The development of immunity against viruses like SARS-CoV-2 requires specific antibodies produced by the human body in response to exposure or vaccination, not through consuming food.

There is currently no evidence-based medical or scientific support for the claim that maize can confer immunity against COVID-19.

Decision: False"
133,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: COVID-19 заражає тільки людей, що живуть з хронічними захворюваннями, такими як астма і діабет.",False,False,"This statement is false. The headline claims that on July 8, 2020, it was stated that COVID-19 infects only people with chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes. However, this is not true based on the scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) at that time and since then. The virus can infect individuals regardless of their health status, although those with underlying conditions may be more susceptible to severe illness.

Decision: False"
134,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: поглинання або купування продуктів, що містять конопліолі (CBD), збільшить вашу імунну систему і допоможе запобігти COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?",False,False,"The statement claims that consuming products containing CBD (cannabidiol) will boost your immune system and help prevent COVID-19. To evaluate this, it's important to note the current scientific understanding of CBD.

CBD is a compound found in cannabis and hemp plants. It has been studied for various potential health benefits but there isn't strong evidence that consuming CBD directly boosts the immune system or provides protection against diseases like COVID-19.

While some preliminary studies have suggested that CBD may interact with the endocannabinoid system, which can influence immune function, there is no conclusive evidence to support that it specifically enhances immunity or prevents viral infections such as those caused by SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).

Therefore, based on current scientific knowledge and research, this statement appears to be an oversimplification of the potential effects of CBD. It overstates the benefits and lacks scientific backing.

Decision: False"
135,Насіння Акації захищало вас від COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The headline ""Насіння Акації захищало вас від COVID-19"" translates to ""Acacia seeds protected you from COVID-19.""

This statement is false. There is no scientific evidence or medical research that supports the claim that acacia seeds can protect against or prevent COVID-19. The protection from this virus primarily comes from vaccination, following health guidelines like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, and using appropriate sanitizers.

Decision: False"
136,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено заяву: пити багато води і пити теплою солоною водою видаляє вірус COVID-19.,False,False,"This headline translates to English as follows: ""On July 8, 2020, a statement was made: drink plenty of water and drink warm salty water removes the coronavirus COVID-19.""

Analysis:
The claim that drinking water or salty water can remove the coronavirus is not supported by scientific evidence. There are no known treatments that involve drinking fluids to cure COVID-19 as it primarily affects the lungs and respiratory system, requiring medical intervention such as oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, and in severe cases, hospitalization.

The World Health Organization (WHO) does recommend staying well hydrated as part of general health maintenance but has not endorsed this specific claim. The idea that salty water can remove a virus from the body is scientifically implausible without further evidence to support it.

Therefore, the statement is false.

Decision: False"
137,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: COVID-19 поширюється через пальне, і кожен повинен носити рукавички, заповнюючи бензин у своїх машинах.",False,False,"The statement translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, the following claim was made: COVID-19 spreads through gasoline, and everyone should wear gloves while filling up their cars.""

This is a false statement for several reasons:

1. **Fact Check**: There is no credible scientific evidence that supports the notion that COVID-19 spreads through gasoline or that wearing gloves while fueling vehicles can prevent its spread.

2. **Misinformation**: Such claims are often misleading and intended to spread misinformation, which can lead to unnecessary public health concerns and actions.

Therefore, my decision based on this analysis is: False"
138,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таку заяву: носити взуття у себе вдома було причиною поширення COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи неправильне?,False,False,"The statement claims that on July 8, 2020, a claim was made that wearing shoes at home was a cause of the spread of COVID-19.

This claim is false. According to reliable health information sources and medical research, there is no evidence or scientific basis for the assertion that wearing shoes at home causes the spread of COVID-19. The primary modes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 are believed to be through respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals.

Therefore, the decision is: False"
139,Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: приймаємо ібупрофен погіршує симптоми COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?,False,False,"The statement in Ukrainian translates to English as follows:

""On July 8, 2020, it was stated that taking ibuprofen worsens the symptoms of COVID-19.""

To analyze this, we need to consider historical context and medical knowledge. In early March 2020, there were concerns about whether NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen might worsen the progression of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). However, this claim was based on very limited evidence and was not definitively proven at the time.

On July 8, 2020, a study published in The Lancet found no significant difference between the use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs compared to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in people with COVID-19. This finding suggested that taking ibuprofen did not worsen symptoms or lead to worse outcomes.

Given this context, the statement is misleading because it reflects a concern that was never conclusively proven as true, and subsequent research has not supported the claim that ibuprofen worsens COVID-19 symptoms.

Decision: False"
140,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: хтось повинен залишатися вдома в конкретний час, коли вертольоти розбризкують дезінфекцію над домами за те, що вбили COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement appears to be a mix of Ukrainian and Russian text, which is unusual and might indicate it has been mishandled or mistranslated. The core message seems to relate to someone being required to stay at home during pesticide spraying by helicopters, supposedly because they caused the death of COVID-19.

However, there is no credible evidence suggesting that anyone can be legally compelled to stay indoors due to a supposed cause-and-effect relationship with their presence and the use of pesticides in fighting against COVID-19. This seems more like a fabricated claim than an actual event based on current verified information.

Decision: False"
141,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: вітамін D таблетки можуть запобігти COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве, чи фальшиве?",False,False,"The statement in the headline translates to English as follows:
""On July 8, 2020, this claim was made: vitamin D tablets can prevent COVID-19.""

To analyze this statement:

1. The date (July 8, 2020) is specific.
2. It claims that vitamin D supplements can prevent COVID-19.

Based on current scientific understanding and information available up to the latest updates, there is no definitive evidence that vitamin D alone prevents or cures COVID-19. However, vitamin D plays a role in supporting overall health and immune function. Some studies suggest it may have benefits when combined with other nutrients and under certain circumstances, but it cannot be stated definitively as a preventive measure for COVID-19.

Given the specific nature of the claim and the current scientific consensus, this statement is considered:

False

The reason: While vitamin D is important for overall health and immune function, there is no strong evidence that taking vitamin D supplements alone can prevent COVID-19."
142,"Восьмого липня 2020 року було зроблено таке твердження: одягнуто теплі шкарпетки і гірчиці, а також розщеплення гусястого жиру на грудях - це лікування для COVID-19. Q: Чи це твердження правдиве чи хибне?",False,False,"This statement is fabricated and not based on any scientifically recognized or reported treatment for COVID-19. The methods described—wearing warm socks and mustard, as well as splitting goose grease into pieces—are not supported by medical science or public health authorities.

Therefore, the answer is: False."
