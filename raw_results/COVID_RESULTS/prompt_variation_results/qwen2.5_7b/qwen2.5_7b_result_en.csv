SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV, while COVID-19 is caused by another coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Key differences include:

1. **Origin**: The first case of SARS was reported in 2002, while the first known case of COVID-19 was reported around late 2019.
2. **Transmission and Spread**: Both viruses can spread through respiratory droplets, but their transmission rates and patterns may differ. For instance, early evidence suggested that SARS could have more significant person-to-person spread in close settings like hospitals, while the rapid global spread of COVID-19 highlights its high transmissibility.
3. **Pathology and Severity**: While both can cause severe respiratory illness, the severity of symptoms and mortality rates vary between the two. SARS was associated with a higher mortality rate (around 10%) compared to COVID-19, which has a lower overall mortality rate but has affected more people globally.
